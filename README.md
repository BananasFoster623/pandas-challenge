****NOTE: The Scores by School Spending table has an error when disiplayed in GitHub. The bins do not properly display and only show two bins when there are really four. This error does not exist when run in Jupyter Notebooks. 

**** NOTE: All code description has been moved from this ReadMe to the actual Jupyter Notebook file as inline markdown cells to faciliate easier code interpretation. 

#### Analysis of Observable Trends

1) It is clear that Charter Schools outperform the District schools. An additional table was included at the bottom of the notebook, showing that all of the Charter Schools performed better than the District schools.  The per student budget for these schools varies, but is not universally higher than District schools. Another additional table was included at the bottom of the notebook showing that the average per student spending for Charter Schools was significantly less than Distric schools. Total Students for Charter Schools was less than 50% of what it is for District schools, indicating that size of the student body is a good indicator of overall school performance. Number of teachers and administrators at each school would be a very good data point to explore this further. 

2) No discernable trend can be observed from this analysis showing a correlation between grade level and percent passing. It also does not appear that Charter or District schools have an impact on this correlation. There is no difference in Math or Reading scores, either. However, the data does not indicate if this data is from a single year or follows a group of students through their 4 years of high school. A better analysis would be to take a snapshot every year for 4 years to see if a group of students improves over time and whether Charter or District schools do a better job of improving student grades over time.
